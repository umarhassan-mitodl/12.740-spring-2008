description: Lecture presentation on oxygen isotope paleothermometry, cumulative Rayleigh
  isotope distillation as a function of temperature, oxygen isotopes of precipitation
  over North America, Emiliani's ice volume correction, determining the isotopic composition
  of ice sheets from the last glacial maximum, pore water chlorinity and oxygen isotopes,
  the effect of glaciation on the oxygen isotope composition of the ocean, sea-level
  estimates from drilling submerged coral terraces, oxygen isotope stratigraphy, and
  paleomagnetic stratigraphy.
