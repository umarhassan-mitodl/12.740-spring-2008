description: Lecture notes on atmospheric carbon dioxide, ocean chemistry, and mechanisms
  of climate change, ice core evidence for changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide,
  carbon dioxide digression, carbon dioxide  exchange between the ocean and atmosphere,
  coral reef hypotheses, the nutrient deepening/alkalinity response model, the rain
  ratio model, the sea ice/gas exchange mechanism, nitrate as a limiting nutrient,
  change in mode of southern ocean deepwater formation, and oceanic Si reorganization.
